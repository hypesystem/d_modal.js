<!-- CREATING MODALS -->
<section id="create-modals">

	<div class="d-modal d-modal-blocking">Hello. This modal was generated by the <code>jquery.d_modal.js</code> library.</div>
	
	<p>
		The modal you just encountered was automatically instantiated by having the class <code>.d-modal</code>:
	</p>
	<code class="code-example" id="code-example-1">
		&lt;div class="d-modal d-modal-blocking"&gt;<br>
		Hello. This modal was generated by the &lt;code&gt;jquery.d_modal.js&lt;/code&gt; library.<br>
		&lt;/div&gt;
	</code>
	
	<p>
		<em>d_modal</em> is a jQuery library with an emphasis on simplicity and ease-of-use. It's easy to
		create a new modal:
	</p>
	<code class="code-example showme">
		$.d_modal("This is a new modal.");
	</code>
	
	<p>
		It supports multiple modals (by simply stacking them) &ndash; try clicking the "Show me" button several times.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You may notice that the modals created with the code above don't block the screen. We can change that:
	</p>
	<code class="code-example showme">
		$.d_modal("Blocking modal", {<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;blocking: true<br>
		});
	</code>
	
	<p>
		There are a few more options you can use to customize the modal.

<!-- USING MODALS IN jQuery -->
<section id="modals-in-jquery">

	<p>
		The created modal is a jQuery object, so you can chain calls just like you're used to!
	</p>
	<code class="code-example showme">
		$.d_modal("Happy modal").addClass("success");
	</code>
	
	<div class="warning">
		Using <code>text()</code> and <code>html()</code> will overwrite everything inside the modal,
		and may break functionality. You should instead use <code>d_modal.text()</code> and
		<code>d_modal.html()</code>. <a href="/documentation/#special-cases">Read more</a>
	</div>

</section>

<!-- CUSTOMIZING MODALS -->
<section id="customizing-modals">

	<p>
		On the topic of customizations... it's easy to change the look of the modal, and you can do
		this however you want. A sample stylesheet
		(<a href="/src/d_modal-default.less"><code>d_modal-default.less</code></a>) is included
		so you know where to start.
